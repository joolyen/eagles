## Portfolio Site

I have created a responsive portfolio website as the homework instructed. The images are responsive and the code is semantic. I used W3C schools to verify and all three pages used semantic code and had no errors. 

I accomplished everything necessary with this project except the mobile portfolio view. I did not leave myself enough time to troubleshoot that. 

The css file should have adequite spacing for you to review as recommended last time. I also included a sticky footer. I could have uploaded my code to GitHub a little more often I just kept working through the different parts without sending my code up as frequently as I should have. 

The site itself contains information about Wu-Tang Clan because they are one of my favorite groups. The images on the portfolio section are random and the contact form doesn't go anywhere. 

I have sumbitted the site on BCS
