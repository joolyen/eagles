# Refactoring Homework - Julian Ivey

This homework is a good one to start with. I kept finding things I cloud fix and I am stopping at the mobile layout. I think I caught a lot of issues and they should be pretty well documented in the comments for each commit. I will try and list them below. BTW, if this isn't what you had in mind for the read me file, let me know and I'll adjust. 

Here's the list of my changes, not in order. 

adding a copy of the homework to the repo
 - I initially needed to add the files to the repo
initial creation and commit of read me
 - This was for my description of the homework
changes footer h2 to h4
 - putting the heading tags in order as the assignment requested
updating the page title
 - I used the title in the footer. It was short enough and descriptive enough
adding jump links from the nav to the services
 - I had a typo on this commit, I was adding jump links to the navigation links so they'd link to their respective service sections of the page
refactoring some of the css classes that were used multiple times
 - some of the benefits tags and the services css tags could be consolidated into one name and one line of code
testing different contrast colors
 - Just trying different color combinations to reach the right contrast levels for accessibility guidelines
copyright update to 2020
 - I figured this should be updated to reflect the current year but I may be wrong
compressed the images to reduce file size for faster load times
 - I noticed the jpg images we're using were large file sizes and I figure that they could be compresses without end users being able to really tell a different visually. That saved about 80-90% of file size on the 4 jpg images I compressed. You can tell which images they are because I left the .min in the file name but they are the header and the three service images
Images must have alternate text
 - Making sure the images had alt tags and text
adding more contrast to .benefits by darkening blue #09405
 - This changed worked for constrast but I didn't like it so I adjusted it later
 
 I also removed the "./" that processed the file paths. I've never seen that before, should I be doing that?
